This is just a sample to check , pipelining funcitonality in the Azure DevOps


With this I plan to test the test manager as well. Ohter topics intended to be covered:

Work Items
CI/CD implementation
Release and staging workflows

This is the addition to the DevOps bracn and its changes.

The TestManager is required to start using the Testing portion in the Azure DevOps

Definitely think about the bulk upload in work items
